//! K7 from #57 — locks in the invariant that `ShimProcess::pending`
//! does not accumulate entries when `send_and_await` times out.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! `process.pending` is a `DashMap<u64, oneshot::Sender<ShimResponse>>`
//! keyed by `request_id`. Each `send_and_await` call inserts an entry
//! before writing the request frame and (in the happy path) the demux
//! loop removes it when the matching response comes back. On the
//! unhappy path — shim crashes mid-request, send-side mpsc closed,
//! recv-side timeout — the cleanup MUST happen via the explicit
//! `process.pending.remove(&request_id)` calls in each error arm of
//! `send_and_await`.
//!
//! The Step 7 finding 5(c) of #56's plan-doc identified this as a
//! load-bearing invariant: if a future regression wraps `send_and_await`
//! in a caller-side `tokio::select!` (so the future is dropped before
//! the internal timeout fires), the cleanup arms never execute and
//! `pending` leaks one entry per cancelled call. The comment at
//! `shim_manager::probe_health` documents the rule ("timeout is enforced
//! INSIDE `send_and_await`, so cancelling the returned future cannot
//! leak entries") but no automated test had pinned it down — until
//! now.
//!
//! ## What's tested
//!
//! Constructs a `ShimProcess` directly (no fake-chromium subprocess, no
//! real socketpair) by holding a `(request_tx, request_rx)` pair where
//! the receiver is parked and never drained. This guarantees that any
//! `send_and_await` call goes through:
//!   1. Insert into `pending`
//!   2. `request_tx.send(req)` succeeds (channel still open)
//!   3. The shim never responds (because there is no shim)
//!   4. The `recv_timeout` fires inside `send_and_await`
//!   5. The cleanup arm removes from `pending`
//!
//! Asserting `pending.is_empty()` after step (5) locks the invariant in.
//!
//! ## What's NOT tested
//!
//! The "future dropped by caller's `tokio::select!`" case is deliberately
//! NOT tested here. That case is the FAILURE MODE the invariant protects
//! against — the design forbids caller-level `tokio::select!`-wrapping
//! precisely BECAUSE it would leak `pending`. Asserting that it leaks
//! would just lock in current buggy behaviour. The protection lives at
//! the type/policy level (the documented "do not wrap" rule), not at
//! the runtime level.
