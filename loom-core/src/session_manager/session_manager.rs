// SessionManager — session lifecycle FSM owner.
//
// # Contract semantics
// - **FSM:** `Created → Active → Closed | Aborted | Killed | Crashed`.
//   Transitions guarded by per-session `Mutex<SessionStatus>`.
// - **Per-session tokio task.** Each session runs on a
//   dedicated multi-threaded tokio task with its own arena.
// - **Abort propagation.** Each session owns
//   `Arc<Notify>` + `Arc<AtomicBool>`. `abort()` flips the bool and
//   calls `notify.notify_one()`. Host-fn entries check the bool;
//   `tokio::select!` races real call vs notify.
// - **Warm create budget.** ULID gen + ensure_dir + WAL
//   header append + fsync + task spawn. NO WASM/Chromium/network on the
//   sync path.
// - **Kill-callback registration.** `create()` registers an
//   `Arc<dyn Fn(SessionId, KillReason)>` into `BudgetEnforcer` so a
//   budget breach can interrupt this session's task without a
//   structural cycle.
